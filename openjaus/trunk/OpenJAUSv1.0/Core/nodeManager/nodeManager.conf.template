# USER: Make a copy of this template and rename the copy, "nodeManager.conf"
# USER: Change the Subsystem and Node information to reflect your configuration
# USER: Ensure the NETWORK_INTERFACE and SUBSYSTEM_SIDE_INTERFACE parameters are correct

# This is the unique numeric ID number and name for the subsystem that this node belongs to

# The following two parameters define the behavior of the node manager. The NETWORK_INTERFACE is the ethernet 
# device which will be used by the node manager to talk to other components on its subsystem. The 
# SUBSYSTEM_SIDE_INTERFACE is used only by the "primary" node manager (usually Node ID 1) to talk to other subsystems.

# These should be left as-is. All JAUS traffic should come and go on port 3794. The Component ports are used for 
# interprocess communication via the loopback device.
