OpenJAUS is a Free Open Source Software implementation of the Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems. This is the development site, where you can discuss the software with the developers, look at future milestones, or see what changed recently.

OpenJAUS started it's life as the libraries and applications developed at the University of Florida for Team CIMAR's entry in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. It was also used by the University of Florida in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. (Team Gator Nation's 2007 entry)

Functioning software currently available:

 * libjaus - all of the JAUS 3.3 messages
 * libopenJaus - a compilation of advanced JAUS functionality including a C++ Node Manager, Component Library and the Node Manager Interface
 * ojNodeManager - an implementation of the OpenJAUS Node Manager class which provides a console-based  
 * ojVehicleSim - contains a sample of a complete unmanned vehicle, with a Primitive Driver, Waypoint Driver, Global Position Sensor, and Velocity State Sensor. 

This means that OpenJAUS has everything you need to implement a fully functioning JAUS compliant robot.

Features

 * Proven Compliance and Interoperability (participated successfully in OPC 2, 2.5, 2.75 and 3.0)
 * OSI-Compliant license allows royalty-free use, modification and distribution of software built with OpenJAUS
 * Wide range of supported platforms (x86, PowerPC, ARM)
 * Compiles and runs in many environments, including Linux (using gcc) and Microsoft Windows (using Microsoft Visual C++)
 * Stable and mature codebase
 * Node Manager employs Berkeley Sockets Interprocess Communication (BSD IPC) for fast and efficient communication between components on one or more machines.
